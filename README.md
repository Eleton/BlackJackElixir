# BlackJack

I made a Black Jack command line game in Elixir.

## Installation

With at least elixir 1.6 installed, run
```
iex -S mix
````
from the root directory and follow the command line instructions to play the game.

Each game is started with a newly shuffled complete deck.
You win if you score more than the dealer without exceeding 21. Even score results in a tie.
